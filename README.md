# NetworkDynamics
Three homework form the Netwrok Dynamics course at @PoliTo 


## Homework 1:
Write a code in order to model the DeGroot dynamics in a network representing Florence families in 14th century, considering stubborn nodes.

## Homework 2:
Study how to model a Poisson Process in a system composed of particled moving aroung different points in a network.

## Homework3 3:

During the fall of 2009 there was a large pandemic of the H1N1-virus, commonly known as the swine-flu. 
During this pandemic it is estimated that about 1.5 million people in Sweden were infected. 
As an attempt to stop the pandemic and reduce excess mortality the government issued a vaccination program beginning in week 40 of 2009. 
During the weeks that followed they vaccinated more than 60% of the Swedish population.
The aim of this homewrok is to simulate the pandemic with the goal of learning the networkstructure characteristics and disease-dynamics parameters of the pandemic in Sweden 2009.
This task will be divided into 4 parts where the focus of each part is to:
1. get started and learn how to:
a. simulate a pandemic on a known graph;
b. generate a random graph;
2. simulate the disease propagation on a random graph without vaccination;
3. simulate disease propagation on a random graph with vaccination;
4. estimate the network-structure characteristics and disease-dynamics parameters for the
pandemic in Sweden during the fall of 2009.
All numbers regarding the H1N1 pandemic in Sweden during the fall of 2009 have been taken
from the a report by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (Myndigheten f¨or samh¨allsskydd
och beredskap, MSB) and the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (Smittskyddsinstitutet, SMI).
